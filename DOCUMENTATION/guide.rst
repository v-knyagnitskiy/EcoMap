#. Go to `'path/to/repo/ecomap/DB/ecomap/'` directory
#. Run mysql shell:  ``mysql -u -p``
#. Run following command:  ``CREATE DATABASE ecomap_db CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;``  - this command will create database if it's not created yet. Put the name you want instead of 'ecomap_db'

APACHE
------
Ecomap application runs on ``Apache Web Server v2.4``
This is a short manual, which tells how to configure WSGI-Flask application and
Apache server on your server or local machine.

#. Install Apache 2 and mod_wsgi lib:
     ``sudo apt-get install -y apache2``
     ``sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi``
     ``sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi python-dev``

#. Enable wsgi mod:
     ``sudo a2enmod wsgi``

#. Edit your hosts file to create server name alias
     ``sudo gedit /etc/hosts``

#. Add this line to th your host file:
     ``127.0.1.2   ecomap.new``

#. Run following command:
     ``sudo gedit /etc/apache2/sites-available/ecomap.conf``
     This command will create file ecomap.conf - this is config file of your site. You can set any name you want!

#. Add content from apache.conf file, which is situated in -  ``ecomap/etc/apache.conf``  to ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/ecomap.conf``

#. Enable your site: ``sudo a2ensite ecomap``

#. Make your own copy of ecomap.wsgi (situated in  ecomap/www/ecomap.wsgi ).
Also read comments in that file, since they are important! This is your main wsgi script which apache will use to run         application. It has already configured for our project structure. You can set your own path to templates folder and          you'll see test site.


**views.py**  - this is main flask application file.

All backend code will be written there. You can change  everything right now!
